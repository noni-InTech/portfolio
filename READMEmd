# Portfolio home (scaffold)

This simple static scaffold contains a home page with a navigation bar and a hero section that uses a looping background video.

Files added:
- index.html — homepage with nav + hero video
- styles.css — styles for layout and responsive nav
- script.js — mobile nav toggle

Run locally:
1. Open the folder in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` or run in PowerShell:

```powershell
start index.html
```

Replace the video:
- By default the hero uses a sample MP4 hosted on MDN. To use your own file, replace the `src` in the `video` element in `index.html` with a local path like `assets/hero-video.mp4` or a remote URL.

Accessibility notes:
- The video is muted and autoplaying; keep it muted to allow autoplay in browsers. Provide meaningful text content over the video (already present).
